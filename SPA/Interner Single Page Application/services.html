            <h3>The world relies on a secure and trustworthy Internet.</h3>
    
            <p>Every minute of every hour, people connect with one another online, sharing information, ideas, and dreams.
            </p>
            <p>Working with our global community, we help make the Internet a trustworthy place. Together, we advocate to
              keep the Internet resilient and functioning—secure wherever it reaches.</p>

              <h5>What is the Splinternet?</h5>
              <p>You open your favorite search engine—only to be routed to a government-approved source. You try to access
                social media, but it’s blocked. This is the splinternet, where fragmented networks are controlled by
                governments or corporations, and this is what it’s like for millions of people across the world. Some
                countries only allow residents to access sites the government deems “safe.” Other countries want to follow
                their lead. If we let it gain ground it’ll destroy the Internet as we know it—and the human progress it
                makes possible.</p>
